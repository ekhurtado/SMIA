SMIA is a software that implements an AAS-compliant Digital Twin (DT) that is based on a flexible manufacturing-centered ontology.

  :alt: SMIA main logo

The features of the SMIA approach include:

    - free & open-source
    - standardized approach (compliant with consolidated standards: AAS, CSS, FIPA, OWL, etc.)
    - Ontology-based
    - easily customizable and extendable
    - self-configuration at software startup
    - containerized solution

.. important::

    The SMIA software is developed as part of scientific research. If you use SMIA in scientific works, please cite the following articles.

Quick Start
-----------

New to SMIA? This section will guide you through getting started with the software quickly and easily.

.. dropdown:: 1. Easy installation
    :octicon:`terminal;1em;sd-text-primary`

    SMIA provides open-source code, as well as various installation methods. We recommend using the pip package manager, which allows you to install it with a single command:

    .. code:: bash

        pip install smia

    **Learn more:** :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`Installation Guide`

.. dropdown:: 2. Configuration of CSS-enriched AAS Model
    :octicon:`pencil;1em;sd-text-primary`

    SMIA self-configures from a valid CSS-enriched AAS model. For its generation, it is recommended the *AASX Package Explorer* editor (learn how to install and configure it on the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`Installation Guide`).

    **Learn how to generate valid models:** :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`AAS Development Guide`

    .. tip::

        If you need to extend SMIA with increased autonomy (or add your own code), you can can refer to the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Extension Guide`.

.. dropdown:: 3. Seamless deployment: Environment Builder
    :octicon:`rocket;1em;sd-text-primary`

    To automatically create deployment environments, we recommend using the dedicated *SMIA Environment Builder* tool, which is part of this documentation platform.

    This tool generates valid SMIA deployment environments based on your choices (local environments, or virtualized environments using Docker Compose or Kubernetes). It allows you to attach AASX models for asset digitization through SMIA and to select the necessary infrastructure.

    **Access it from:** :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Environment Builder`

    .. tip::

        Especially for local environments, you can also follow the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Start-up Guide`.

.. dropdown:: 4. SMIA in operation
    :octicon:`gear;1em;sd-text-primary`

    SMIA agents are designed to be part of distributed systems, communicating via standardized FIPA-SMIACL messages. To verify that the SMIA agents are functioning properly, you can analyze directly the console or use one of the following tools:

    - **SMIA Operator:** extended agent that offers a graphical web interface to discover SMIA agents, and view their CSS-related information, and request CSS-related executions (completely abstracts the necessary FIPA-SMIACL interactions).
        **Learn more:** :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA ecosystem SMIA Operator`.
    - **SMIA PE:** extended agent with autonomy to interpret and automatically execute flexible BPMN workflows.
        **Learn more:** :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA ecosystem SMIA PE`.
    - **Direct communication:** Interact programmatically using FIPA-SMIACL messages when extending SMIA (see :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Extension Guide`).


.. dropdown:: 5. Recommended Next Steps
    :octicon:`zap;1em;sd-text-primary`

    To learn more about the SMIA approach:

    - **Guided Tutorial:** Follow the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`Step-by-step tutorials <Guided tutorials>` to achieve comprehensive implementation cases.
    - **Extend SMIA:** Read the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Extension Guide` to add new logic: custom agent capabilities, services, or asset connections.
    - **Analyze Use Cases:** Check :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA Use Cases` to see real-world applications
    - **Explore the Ecosystem:** Look into the :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA ecosystem` for additional resources and tools available.
