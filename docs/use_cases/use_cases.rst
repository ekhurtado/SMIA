Cooperative transport logistics use case
----------------------------------------

This use case represents a robotic logistics production scenario, in which a plant operator will request efficient transports performed by robots.

    The use case is detailed in :octicon:`file-symlink-file;1em` :ref:`Cooperative transport logistics <Use case transport logistics>`.

CeDRI IPB demonstrator use case
-------------------------------

This use case represents a flexible production scenario, in which some different asset will interact to realize production plans.

    The use case is detailed in :octicon:`file-symlink-file;1em` :ref:`CeDRI IPB demonstrator <CeDRI IPB demonstrator>`.
